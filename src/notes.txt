Need to understand MVCC Snapshots in b-tree and pages

Need to understand what bitmap scans are

Need to understand how VACUUMs work

Need to understand ascending logic and locking

Need to understand file offsets and blocks

Need to understand how pins work and how they're different from latches

Need to understand what suffix truncation is
- Suffix truncations is taking a range of sub-keys and removing the trailing bytes at the first point they different
- this is used to store separator keys
- Prefix compression compresses keys stored downward
Example suffix truncation = apple_green, apple_red -> apple_r (which would be the high_key/separator in the parent)

Need to understand split page logic - byte aware splits?

// Need pin logic for internal pages - if pinned directly address from arena, if not then go through cache
// Need better lock for internal maybe optimistic version locking


// Confirmed that there is one cache for pages UNLESS we pin to memory
// Confirmed there is one lock for pages which resides in the cache/mapping table UNLESS we pin to memory

// Steps forward is to have 3 elements [Mapping table - Buffer, PageManager] PageManager will coordinate and wire up the mapping table with the buffer
// Calling code such as tree will only interact with the PageManager

//

TODO

- We need to work on the slotted page file and add in methods for when a caller needs to split pages or transfer data over etc
- So we need a split_at method
- We need a transfer_method which takes a mut Slotted Page as paramater
- We also need to do some work with the Slot Array as we know how many cells we have and their sizes so we can apply some logic to determine good splits and return good errors or context based on this
- Then we need to define good tests
